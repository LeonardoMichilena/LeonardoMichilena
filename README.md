### Hola mundo! ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**LeonardoMichilena/LeonardoMichilena** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

-->

Here are some facts to get to know me better:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on improving my coaching skills,  also going deeper with Angular based projects, backend basics with Firebase, and mobile adaptation
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... how/where to start learning code or how to improve your programming skills, and not give up along the way!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: leonardomichilena@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ... you can call me by my name ;)
- âš¡ Fun fact: ... sometimes I can't code if someone is watching... 

and remember: don't judge a programmer by their README!
