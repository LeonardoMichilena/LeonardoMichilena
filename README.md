### Hola mundo! 👋

<!--
**LeonardoMichilena/LeonardoMichilena** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

-->

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🌱 I’m currently working on improving my Coaching skills,  also going deeper with Angular based projects, backend basics with Firebase, and mobile adaptation
- 💬 Ask me about ... how/where to start learning code or how to improve your programming skills, and not give up along the way!
- 📫 How to reach me: leonardomichilena@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: ... just call me by my name ;)
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... sometimes I can't code if someone is watching... 

and remember: don't judge a programmer by his README!
